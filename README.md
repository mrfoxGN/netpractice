# NetPractice

## Description

**NetPractice** is a training project from the 42 curriculum focused on understanding and mastering **computer networking fundamentals**.  
The goal of this project is to correctly configure network topologies by assigning valid IP addresses, subnet masks, and routes so that all hosts can communicate as expected.

Through a series of progressively difficult levels, the project develops a solid understanding of how networks operate at a low level, especially how devices communicate within and across subnets.

Key objectives include:
- Understanding IPv4 addressing
- Subnetting and CIDR notation
- Default gateways and routing logic
- Network device roles (routers vs switches)
- Logical network connectivity validation

---

## Instructions

### Running the Training Interface

1. Open the NetPractice interface:
   - Simply open the provided `index.html` file in a web browser  
     (Firefox or Chromium-based browsers are recommended).

2. Select a level:
   - The interface contains **10 levels**, each representing a different network topology.

3. Configure the network:
   - Assign IP addresses
   - Set subnet masks
   - Configure gateways and routes if required

4. Validate the configuration:
   - Use the built-in validation to ensure all nodes can communicate correctly.

---

### Exporting Configurations

- After successfully completing a level, **export the configuration** using the interface.
- The export generates a configuration file (usually `.json` or similar).

---

### Submission Requirements

- **Exactly 10 exported configuration files** must be submitted
- **One configuration per level**
- All exported files must be placed **at the root of the Git repository**
- No subfolders are allowed for submission files

### Networking Concepts Studied

This project explicitly covers and reinforces the following networking concepts:

- **TCP/IP addressing**
- **IPv4 structure**
- **Subnet masks and CIDR notation**
- **Network address vs broadcast address**
- **Default gateway**
- **Routers and switches**
- **Routing between networks**
- **OSI Model layers**
- **Private vs public IP ranges**
- **Point-to-point links**

### Use of Artificial Intelligence

AI tools (such as ChatGPT) were used **only for learning and clarification purposes**, including:
- Explaining subnetting logic
- Clarifying routing behavior
- Verifying conceptual understanding of networking rules
- Improving README structure and documentation clarity

All network configurations were **designed and validated manually** by the student.

## Notes

- This project is purely educational and does not require real network hardware.
- All configurations are logical simulations inside the NetPractice interface.
- A strong understanding of this project is essential for system, backend, and DevOps roles.
